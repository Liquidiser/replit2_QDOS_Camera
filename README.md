## Building the App

### Quick Build Options

Several build scripts are available to simplify the build process:

1. **EAS Cloud Build** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   # Make script executable
   chmod +x eas-build.sh
   
   # Run EAS build with preview profile
   ./eas-build.sh preview
   ```

2. **Local Android Build**:
   ```bash
   # Make script executable
   chmod +x build-android.sh
   
   # Build debug APK
   ./build-android.sh debug
   
   # Or build release APK
   ./build-android.sh release
   ```

3. **External Build Preparation**:
   ```bash
   # Make script executable
   chmod +x prepare-build.sh
   
   # Prepare files for external building
   ./prepare-build.sh
   ```

For comprehensive build documentation, see [BUILDING_APK.md](BUILDING_APK.md).

## Usage Flow

1. **Launch the app** - The app opens to the home screen
2. **Scan QR Code** - Point camera at a QR code to scan
3. **View Overlay** - See Rive animation overlay on camera view
4. **Capture Media** - Take photos or record video with the overlay
5. **Preview & Edit** - Review captured media
6. **Upload & Share** - Upload to server and share to Twitter

## Key Components

- **Camera Interface** - Uses `react-native-vision-camera` for advanced camera features
- **QR Scanner** - Custom QR detection with real-time processing
- **Rive Animations** - Interactive animations using `rive-react-native`
- **Media Management** - Local storage using `react-native-fs`
- **Background Upload** - Efficient uploads with `react-native-background-upload`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Camera Permission Denied** - Go to device settings and enable camera permissions for the app
- **Storage Permission Denied** - Enable storage permissions in device settings
- **QR Code Not Scanning** - Ensure adequate lighting and QR code is clearly visible
- **Upload Failures** - Check network connection and API key configuration

### Debugging

For development and debugging:

1. Enable developer mode on your device
2. Connect via USB debugging
3. Use Chrome DevTools for remote debugging
4. Check Metro bundler logs for JavaScript errors
5. Review device logs for native-side issues
